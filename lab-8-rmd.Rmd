#there does seem to be a linear relationship but there are two clusters of data that dont seem to fit in the model.

```{r}
#Part 5- Linear Regression in R

#General syntax for linear regression in R

#model_name <- lm(y_variable ~ x_variable, data = df_name)

#For this model:
salmon_model <- lm(salmon_fresh ~ year, data = salmon_freshest)
salmon_model

#equation: y=mx+b so eq is: imports(thousands of pounds)= 7550(year)-14,982,940
